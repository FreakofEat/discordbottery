## the world's first computer application

An ever changing number of environment variables are required to be set for full functionality of the bot, so you probably shouldn't bother.
(Though, you may be able to get with just DISCORD_TOKEN as your discord bot's token and by commenting any erroneous lines (and by looking at the discordpy requirements))

Rather, you should just copy the bits of code that are relevant to you and add it to your own project.

Features include:
- Queued music player with search!! (supports most websites through youtube-dl and google play music)
- Custom command creator
- Tweet through the bot
- Markov chain generator based on users
- Timed events
- Various internet things (spelling + grammer checking, bing image search, web scraper)
- funny inside jokes

Check out the .py files in cogs/ for code of the above!!!
